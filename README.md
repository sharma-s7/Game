# Game
(1) Water Snake Gun is a fun, quick-paced game where players choose between water, snake, and gun to compete in a rock-paper-scissors-style battle. Each choice has its own strengths—water beats gun, gun beats snake, and snake beats water. The game is easy to learn but challenging to master, making it great for fast and exciting matches!

➡️ How to Play
Two players (or a player vs. computer) choose Water, Snake, or Gun at the same time.

The winner is determined by the matchup:

Water beats Gun (water puts out gunpowder).

Gun beats Snake (gun defeats snake).

Snake beats Water (snake drinks water).

If both players choose the same option, it’s a draw.
